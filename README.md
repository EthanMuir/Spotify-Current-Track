# Spotify-Current-Track
This is a simple program that leverages the Spotify API to access and display whatever song and artist the user is currently listening to on any device

# How to use:
1. Follow this link and sign into your spotify: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-users-currently-playing-track/?market=&additional_types= 
2. Click the 'Get Token' button and select 'user-read-currently-playing'
3. Copy this token and paste it into the code on line 6 in between the quotes
4. Play a song on your Spotify account from any device
5. Run the program

# Limitation
This program will only work if a song is currently playing when it runs.

# Future Use
In the future, I will attempt to use this program to access a song's album cover picture and display this picture onto a small lcd screen to mount on a wall.
